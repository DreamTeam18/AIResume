## Session 12 - 2026-02-06

### Feature #26: System theme preference detected on first visit - PASSING

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Reviewed ThemeProvider.tsx code (lines 18-32)
2. ✅ Confirmed system preference detection logic:
   - Checks localStorage first for saved preference
   - If no saved preference (first visit), uses `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`
   - Returns 'dark' if system is dark, 'light' if system is light
3. ✅ Cleared localStorage to simulate first visit
4. ✅ Verified system preference: light mode detected
5. ✅ Reloaded page and confirmed app loads in light mode (matching system)
6. ✅ Verified theme state:
   - System preference: light
   - Current theme: light (matches system)
   - localStorage: null (no saved preference)
   - HTML class: "" (no 'dark' class)
7. ✅ Tested theme toggle to dark mode
8. ✅ Verified localStorage saves preference after manual toggle
9. ✅ Cleared localStorage again and reloaded - confirmed light mode detection
10. ✅ No console errors detected (0 errors, 5 warnings about loading)

**Implementation Analysis:**
- ThemeProvider.tsx already implements system preference detection
- useEffect hook runs on component mount (line 18-32)
- Logic flow:
  1. Get saved theme from localStorage
  2. If saved theme exists → use it
  3. If no saved theme → detect system preference with matchMedia
  4. Apply detected theme to document.documentElement
- Dark mode class applied to <html> element for Tailwind dark: variants
- Theme persists to localStorage after user toggles manually

**Technical Details:**
- Detection method: `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches`
- Returns boolean: true for dark mode, false for light mode
- Applied via `document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')` or remove
- CSS custom properties update based on theme in globals.css
- Server running on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)

**Screenshots:**
- feature-26-system-light-verified.png: First visit with light system preference
- feature-26-dark-mode-toggled.png: Manual toggle to dark mode
- feature-26-final-verification.png: Final test showing system detection working
