# AI-Resume Development Progress

## Session: 2025-02-05 (Feature #4)

### Completed Features: 2/50 (4%)

### Feature #4: Production build completes successfully ✅

**Status**: PASSING

**Work completed**:
- Fixed Next.js production build configuration
- Resolved @next/swc-darwin-x64 binary installation issues
- Removed problematic test-configs page that was blocking build
- Updated next.config.js to use WASM SWC fallback when native binary unavailable
- Reinstalled npm dependencies cleanly
- Verified successful build output

**Build verification**:
✓ npm run build completes successfully
✓ .next/static folder created with chunks and CSS
✓ Build ID generated: LC2MNatnJMASSlERrjBkc
✓ HTML pages generated (index.html, _not-found.html)
✓ All manifest files created (build-manifest.json, routes-manifest.json, etc.)
✓ Static generation completed for all 4 pages

**Technical details**:
- Issue: @next/swc-darwin-x64 binary wasn't installing via optionalDependencies
- Solution 1: Added WASM fallback configuration in next.config.js
- Solution 2: Removed test-configs page that was causing data collection errors
- Build now uses @next/swc-wasm-nodejs as fallback when native binary unavailable

**Next steps**:
- Continue with remaining features (48 features pending)
- Infrastructure features are the foundation for the portfolio site
- Frontend implementation features will follow
