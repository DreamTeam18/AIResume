# AI-Resume Development Progress

## Session 1 - Infrastructure Testing
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Agent:** Coding Agent
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours

### Features Assigned
- Feature #4: Production build completes successfully
- Feature #5: All configuration files are valid

### Completed ✅
- **Feature #5: All configuration files are valid** - PASSING
  - Verified all config files exist (profile.ts, projects.ts, skills.ts, contact.ts)
  - Confirmed TypeScript compilation succeeds
  - Tested runtime imports successfully using tsx
  - All required fields present and properly typed
  - Committed in: 2a6e0db

### Blocked ⚠️
- **Feature #4: Production build completes successfully** - BLOCKED

  **Issue:** @next/swc-darwin-x64 binary package fails to install

  **Root Cause:**
  - npm install completes but SWC optional dependencies don't install
  - Next.js 14.2.35 requires SWC binary for compilation
  - Network/registry issues prevent downloading the 63MB native binary
  - Attempted workarounds all failed:
    - Manual npm install of @next/swc-darwin-x64
    - npm rebuild
    - npm cache clean + fresh install
    - Installing @next/swc-wasm-nodejs (WASM fallback)
    - Creating .babelrc for Babel fallback
    - Disabling SWC minification in next.config.js
    - Using NEXT_IGNORE_INCORRECT_LOCKFILE=1 env var
    - Creating dummy package directory

  **Error:**
  ```
  ⚠ Attempted to load @next/swc-darwin-x64, but it was not installed
  ⨯ Failed to load SWC binary for darwin/x64
  ```

  **Potential Solutions (for future sessions):**
  1. Downgrade to Next.js 13.x which has better Babel fallback support
  2. Use a different build system (Vite, Webpack directly)
  3. Pre-install SWC binary from a working environment
  4. Use a different machine/environment with working npm registry access
  5. Switch to a version of Next.js that bundles SWC or uses pure JS

### Dependencies Installed
- Next.js 14.2.35
- React 18.3.0
- Framer Motion 11.0.0
- Lucide React 0.309.0
- TypeScript 5.x
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.0
- All development dependencies

### Git Commits
1. `2a6e0db` - Verify and validate all configuration files

### Current Status
- **Features Passing:** 1/50 (2%)
- **Features In Progress:** 1 (Feature #4 - blocked)
- **Blocking Issue:** SWC binary installation failure

### Next Steps
- Feature #4 requires resolution of SWC binary issue before it can pass
- Other infrastructure features may have similar build-related dependencies
- Recommend addressing SWC issue before proceeding with other features

### Notes
- Config files are well-structured and ready for use
- TypeScript setup is correct
- Project structure is sound
- Only blocker is the production build process
