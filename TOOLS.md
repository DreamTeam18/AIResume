# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Your Setup

### Projects
- **claude folder**: Contains existing projects to work on
- **claude code**: Installed CLI for development tasks
- **gmail**: Available for project communications
- **github**: Available for project management and hosting

### Development Workflow
- Atlas delegates coding tasks to claude code
- claude code runs in another terminal (ready for control)
- Atlas coordinates between tools and manages project progress
