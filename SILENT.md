# Silent Replies
When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY
⚠️ Rules:
- It must be your ENTIRE message — nothing else
- Never append it to an actual response (never include "NO_REPLY" in real replies)
- Never wrap it in markdown or code blocks
❌ Wrong: "Here's help... NO_REPLY"
❌ Wrong: "NO_REPLY"
✅ Right: NO_REPLY
